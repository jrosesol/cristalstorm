<p>It's been a decade since BMW entered the SUV/crossover market
	with its X5, creating its own niche with what it describes as the
	'Sports Activity Vehicle'. In that time, the X Series family has become
	a major part of BMW's line - these vehicles now account for a fifth of
	all BMW sales, so it's no surprise the firm is looking to expand on the
	theme.</p>
<p>The range grew to include the compact X3 in 2004, followed by the
	seven-seat capable X5 in 2006, and the segment-bending X6 crossover
	coupe last year. The newest member of the family is the X1, which has
	just gone on sale in Europe. It's the company's smallest crossover to
	date and will be going on sale in Canada come 2011. But is it worth the
	wait?</p>

<p>Before that question can be answered, let's put the X1 into
	context. For starters this isn't an all-wheel-drive 1 Series hatchback.
	Despite the "1" in its name, the X1 shares basic underpinnings with the
	3 Series Touring, which for the first time in the X range opens up the
	opportunity to build a rear-wheel-drive model, dubbed sDrive.
	All-wheel-drive models are also available, and are distinguished by the
	xDrive name. Due to the popularity of all-wheel drive in Canada, it's
	unlikely that the X1 will be offered without all-wheel drive.</p>
<p>Another European exclusive is the X1's diesel-biased engine line:
	out of the four different engines currently offered, only one of them
	is gasoline-powered, the xDrive28i. While BMW hasn't confirmed which
	engines will be sold here, it's a pretty safe bet to assume that this
	one's on the list.</p>

<p>For those not yet familiar with BMW's rather convoluted new model
	naming format the 'x' denotes all-wheel drive and the '28i' a 258-hp
	straight-six engine. Confusingly, the engine's displacement is 3.0
	litres, rather than the 2.8 you might expect. And to add further
	confusion, this is the same engine that's featured in the X3 xDrive30i
	and BMW X5 xDrive30i, rather than the 230-hp six found in the 128i and
	328i models or newly-introduced 215-hp 3.0L six found in the X3
	xDrive28i. Go figure.</p>

	<strong>Where does junior fit in?</strong>

<p>Ah yes, the X3. You're probably wondering where the X1 fits in
	comparison. In terms of its pricing in Europe, the X1 is cheaper than
	both the X3 and 3 Series Touring, and that's likely to remain the same
	for Canada. Size-wise the X1 is 115 mm shorter than the X3 and rides on
	a 35-mm shorter wheelbase. It's also a significant 165-kg lighter, to
	the benefit of fuel consumption, handling and performance. The X1 hits
	0-100 km/h in 6.8 seconds compared to the X3 xDrive30i's 7.6.</p>
<p>Reflecting the X1's junior X5 looks is its performance and the
	way it drives. With a meaty weight to its controls - not just the
	steering - this baby crossover feels just as solid as it looks. Unlike
	the X3 and X5, you sit relatively close to the floor, which adds to the
	sporty feel, although the overall seating position is 80 mm higher than
	in the 3 Series.</p>
